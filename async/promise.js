// Promise is a JavaScript object for asynchronous operations.
// state: peding -> fulfilled or rejected
// Producer vs Consumer

// 1. Producer
// when new Promise is created, the executor runs automatically. 
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // doing some heavy work (network, read files)
  console.log('doing something..');
  setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('park');
  }, 2000);
});

// 2. Consumers: then, catch, finally
promise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
})√ç
